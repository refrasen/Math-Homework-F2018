##### 3. Consider the case of a particle moving directly away from the origin at time $t= 0$ in the Newtonian central force system. Find a specific formula for this solution and discuss the corresponding motion of the particle. For which initial conditions does the particle eventually reverse direction?

What does a particle moving away from origin at $t=0$ tell us about how the particle is moving in accordance with this central force system?

What are the initial conditions we want to consider?



The system without polar coordinates:

$X' = V$ 

$V' = -\frac{X}{|X|^3}$ 

where $X \in \R^3$, $V \in \R^3$(? idk about V, but yeah probably)

Things to consider as well:

* restrict attention to particles moving in the plane $\R^2$
* Configuration space: $C = \R^2 - \{0\}$ 
* Phase space: $P = (\R^2 - \{0\}\times \R^2)$ 
  * the collection of all tangent vectors at each point $X \in C$ 
* $T_X = \{(X, V)| V \in \R^2\}$ : the tangent plane to the configuration at $X$
* $P = \cup_{X \in C}T_X$
